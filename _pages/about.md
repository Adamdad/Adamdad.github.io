 🚀👨‍💻🥁💡Hi, my name is Xingyi Yang (Adam)💡🥁👨‍💻🚀.

I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the [Department of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/dsai/?sc_lang=en) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am also honored to have been selected as the prestigious **Presidential Young Scholars** at PolyU.

I received my Ph.D. from the National University of Singapore (NUS), advised by Prof. Xinchao Wang. I also had a wonderful experience as a visiting Ph.D. student at the University of Oxford, working with Prof. Philip Torr. Prior to that, I completed my Master’s at UC San Diego (UCSD) and my Bachelor’s at Southeast University (SEU).


------

My research lies at the intersection of **generative AI** and **multi-modal learning**, with a strong emphasis on their computational **efficiency**. Our mission is to build intelligent systems that robustly understand, generate, and interact with physical worlds. We hope to achieve this with minimum cost, by tapping and repurposing the rich capabilities of large foundation models through modular, compositional, and post-training techniques.
